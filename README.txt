This is a simple collection of wrapper scripts, resources and a docker
file intended to provide a sandbox for executing student code.

The Dockerfile is tailored specifically to allow one java program and
one python program to run, and to allow editing and access to the VCS
I use (mercurial). Of course, it can be modified quite simply.
